# sqlalchemy challenge

These are the sources I used to help me write my codes: docs.sqlalchemy.org, pandas.pydata.org, matplotlib.org, bing, and BCS — using instructor activity solutions and the class activities as references. 

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
For this part of the challenge, I created my queries to do basic climate analysis and data exploration using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
For this part of the challenge, I designed a Flask API based in the queries I developed from my initial analysis. I created six routes in my Climate App — I started with the homepage, then precipitation route, followed by stations route, tobs route, start route and lastly start/end route.
